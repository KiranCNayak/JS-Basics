# Features that were introduced in different Versions of React

This question was asked in some interviews. Just remember the important ones.

## React 16 Features

1. New Core Architecture codenamed `"Fiber"`. This enables `Fragments` and `Error Boundaries`
2. `Fragments`
3. `Error Boundaries`
4. `Portals`
5. `SSR`
6. Reduced file size
7. React 16 uses `Map` and `Set` under the hood. So older browsers would need Polyfills.
